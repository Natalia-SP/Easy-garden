# Easy-garden
Machine Learning model to take care easily of your plants.
# An easy way to take care of a garden
Most of the people like having plants in their home and office, because hey are beautiful and can connect us with nature just a little bit. But most of the time we really take care of them, and they could get sick. Thinking of this, a system that can monitor the health of plants and tell you if one of them got a disease could be helpful. The system needs to be capturing images at real time and then classify it in diseased or healthy, in case of a disease it can notify you or even provide a treatment for the plant.
# What it does
The model takes an input image and classify it into healthy or disease.
# How I built it
I use datasets of plants healthy and disease found in PlantVillage and developed a machine learning model in Tensorflow using keras API, getting either healthy (1) or diseased (0).
